# 📈 SentiStock: Where Feelings Meet Finances 🤑

Welcome to SentiStock, the app that proves even the stock market has feelings! We're here to turn those dry financial reports into a rollercoaster of emotions. Buckle up!

## 🚀 What's This All About?

SentiStock is your friendly neighborhood sentiment analysis tool for the wild world of stocks. We take the pulse of the market by analyzing news articles, social media buzz, and probably a few fortune cookies along the way.

### 🔮 Features That'll Make Your Portfolio Blush

- **Sentiment Analysis**: We read the news so you don't have to! Our AI deciphers whether the market is feeling bullish, bearish, or just confused.
- **Stock Price Predictions**: We gaze into our crystal ball (aka sophisticated algorithms) to predict future stock prices. Disclaimer: Crystal ball may occasionally need polishing.
- **Category Breakdown**: We categorize news faster than you can say "diversify your portfolio."
- **Fancy Charts**: Because who doesn't love a good chart? Ours come in all colors of the rainbow (as long as that rainbow only has shades of blue and green).

## 🛠 Getting Started (No Financial Advisor Required)

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/uchennanjoku/sentistock.git
   ```
   (If you don't have a GitHub account, just write it down on a napkin. It's basically the same thing.)

2. **Set up your virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   It's like a treehouse for your code. No girls/boys allowed! (Just kidding, everyone's welcome.)

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Warning: This may take a while. Perfect time to contemplate your life choices or make a sandwich.

4. **Run the backend:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   If it works, celebrate! If not, well, there's always cryptocurrency.

5. **Fire up the frontend:**
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Now sit back and watch as your computer pretends to be a stock market expert.

## 🧠 How It Works (Magic, Mostly)

1. You input a stock symbol (like AAPL, because you're basic like that).
2. Our sentiment analyzer reads through news faster than your ex going through your Instagram stories.
3. We crunch numbers, analyze sentiments, and sacrifice a rubber duck to the coding gods.
4. Voila! You get sentiment analysis, price predictions, and pretty charts.
